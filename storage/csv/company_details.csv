<p class=""break-words white-space-pre-wrap mb5 text-body-small t-black--light""><br>We launched in 2016 because banking is boring and broken. Cleo’s not a bank - she’s got your back. Our mission? To empower people to build a life beyond their next paycheck.</p>
<p class=""break-words white-space-pre-wrap mb5 text-body-small t-black--light""><strong>So, what exactly is Cleo?</strong></p>
<p class=""break-words white-space-pre-wrap mb5 text-body-small t-black--light"">Using simplicity and humour, she’s helped 7+ million people improve their relationship with money and financial health. She’s a platform for the 99% – an AI assistant defining a new category, one that goes beyond saving and budgets to actually changing how we feel about our finances.</p>
<p class=""break-words white-space-pre-wrap mb5 text-body-small t-black--light"">Through chat, she provides you with deep insight about your money, while suggesting personalised financial products that increase your ability to save. That said, it’s really our tone of voice that makes us special.</p>
<p class=""break-words white-space-pre-wrap mb5 text-body-small t-black--light"">We’re a product for the next generation. We’re meeting our users where they are and building the type of relationship they expect. That also means dropping the BS.</p>
<p class=""break-words white-space-pre-wrap mb5 text-body-small t-black--light"">In the past year or so we’ve grown the Cleo team from 100 to over 250, closed a $84m Series C led by Sofina (that’s a $500M valuation) and most importantly, helped over 7 million people on their journey towards financial health.</p>
<p class=""break-words white-space-pre-wrap mb5 text-body-small t-black--light"">Find your place at the Fintech that's fighting back. You know that awful feeling when you wake up wondering if what you’re about to do for the next 8 hours actually matters? That doesn’t happen here much. Everything we do is grounded in purpose. And because we’re all showing up for the same reason, collaboration comes easy.</p>
<p class=""break-words white-space-pre-wrap mb5 text-body-small t-black--light"">We’re a culture of stepping up. We want, and expect you to grow and develop. You’ll have our support in everything you do. But more importantly, you’ll have our trust. We treat our people as humans first, employees second. Because we can’t fight for the world’s financial health, if we’re not healthy ourselves.</p>
<p class=""break-words white-space-pre-wrap mb5 text-body-small t-black--light"">We also prioritise everyone having a voice. All perspectives are embraced here and we’re humble enough to know that we’ll always need more of them. Not less.</p>

GoTo Group,Lever,GoToGroup,"About the Team 

We are a team of 4 engineers, focusing on Platform concerns, under the Mobility Marketplace group. Our prime objectives include platformization, and reliability concerns of systems within the marketplace and aim to move towards a composable architecture where new features could be shipped for experimentation by business in a matter of days. We act as a central binding agent for Pricing, Supply, and Matchmaking teams and make sure that the overall architecture and infrastructure is flexible, easily extensible, and scalable.
We keep pondering about how we could improve the availability of the systems by introducing tools to configure and operate clustered solutions. how could we be more agile in on-boarding new use cases to enable opportunities to Mobility Marketplace business? We bounce around ideas and debate with the above themes in mind. Combating remote work has brought us even closer with frequent catch-ups for chit-chat over tea and empathy for each other.

The Marketplace Product Development Team at Gojek handles the hardest quantitative problems related to improving Gojek's real-time marketplace which deeply impacts the everyday experiences of our customers (riders) and drivers.

<p><a href=""http://www.batontrucking.com/"">Baton</a> is seeking ambitious individuals who desire the autonomy and agility of a startup environment combined with the backing, power, reach, and stability of a highly respected logistics industry giant.</p>
<p>Baton is the Silicon Valley-based technology innovation lab for Ryder, a leading logistics company that owns 260k trucks and manages $7.4B of freight.</p>
<p>Prior to the September 2022 acquisition, Baton was a venture-backed start-up that operated a fleet of trucks and hung out at truck stops to truly understand the challenges at hand.</p>
<p><strong>The problem we’re solving</strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to eliminate supply chain waste by creating a digital platform to manage freight and eliminate supply chain waste.</p>
<p>There are 500 million hours wasted in trucking each year, over 3 billion gallons of fuel wasted per year from trucks idling, and 1 in 5 trucks on the road driving empty at any given point. This has a massive impact on the environment, the lives of millions of drivers, and ultimately, the cost of goods that we all pay. Baton is fixing that, and you will too through the impactful work you’ll do here.</p>

Chapter,Greenhouse,chapter,"<h3><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Why Chapter Exists</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Every morning, 11,000 Americans wake up and begin their first day of retirement. While retirement should be an exciting, empowering, and fulfilling part of one’s life, the reality today is that retirement brings along with it a fundamentally new set of challenges that make it an overwhelming time for many.</span><br><br><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">At Chapter, we believe that the current infrastructure for retirement is broken, and we’re on a mission to fix it. We’ve started by building industry leading technology to solve the first major obstacle in retirement: navigating Medicare (healthcare coverage for retirees over 65). Our products help seniors sign up, choose an insurance plan, and leverage their plan after they are enrolled. And, unlike most Medicare advisors who only search plans that pay them, Chapter searches every Medicare option nationwide. This allows us to find savings and benefits that others miss.</span><br><br><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">But our ambition doesn’t stop with Medicare — we seek to transform the way that Americans navigate and experience retirement. If this sounds exciting to you, we’d love to speak with you.</span></p>",askchapter.org,,,https://boards.greenhouse.io/chapter,https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/chapter,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,

Collective Health,Greenhouse,collectivehealth,"<h2><strong>Work at Collective Health!</strong></h2>
<p>We’re a technology company working to create the healthcare experience we all deserve. Our team brings together a unique mix of experience from technology, design, product, finance, and healthcare to solve the hardest problems that get in the way of today’s healthcare experience. We’re always on the lookout for curious, smart and optimistic new members to join the Collective.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The Collective Health Story</strong></h2>
<p>For a good overview of why we started Collective Health, read our founders’ <a href=""https://collectivehealth.com/blog/started-collective-health/"">blog post</a> and watch their <a href=""https://vimeo.com/165830615"">video</a>. In a nutshell, we all deserve better so we’re rebuilding everything about how health benefits work for employers and their people.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, our team of engineers, designers, product managers, and actuaries are redefining the $1 trillion-dollar market of employer-sponsored health insurance with data-driven and people-focused products. Some of the forward-thinking companies already using our product include: Activision Blizzard, Palantir, and Zendesk. We’re backed by some of the best investors in Silicon Valley including Google Ventures, Founders Fund, NEA, and Redpoint Ventures.</p>
<h2><strong>Who We Are</strong></h2>
<p>We believe in transparency, trust, and balance—across the company. We are inclusive, empathetic, and playful in how we approach our work. We put the overall customer experience first: from intuitive product design, to considered engineering, to caring customer support, to explaining things in plain English, to developing data and analytics that actually mean something to our customers and members.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What We're Building</strong></h2>
<p>We are rethinking an industry that hasn’t seen innovation in 30 years—this means our problems are complex and everyone here has interesting challenges to solve. You might be working on building distributed systems up and down our tech stack, creating data analytics and actuarial predictions, managing a product roadmap, designing a part of our service, improving system reliability, building our brand in the market, maintaining our security, or protecting the privacy of our members. We work on big problems with great passion.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We are proudly Farmers First<em>®</em><em>&nbsp;</em>. &nbsp;Created by farmers, for farmers, <em>Farmers Business Network®&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;(<em>FBN®</em>) is an independent and unbiased farmer-to-farmer network of thousands of American farms. &nbsp;By enabling thousands of farmers to work together, anonymously and securely to democratize information and buy smarter, the <em>FBN</em> network is helping farmers level the playing field and put power back in farmers’ hands. &nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>How Does the <em>FBN</em> Network&nbsp;</strong><strong>Work?</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><em>FBN</em> Analytics integrate agronomic data -- from millions of acres and any brand of precision equipment -- into a common analytics system to provide our members incredible insights about their farms. &nbsp;<em>FBN</em> Analytics use the power of machine learning and big data to help our farmers make better decisions, manage risk, and increase profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The <em>FBN</em> Direct&nbsp;and <em>FBN</em> Finance services bring competition, price transparency, and better access on hundreds of ag chemical, fertilizers, seeds and other products manufacturer-direct to farmers - immediately saving our members thousands of dollars. &nbsp;Members frequently save 15-40%, even over 50%&nbsp;on inputs through&nbsp;<em>FBN&nbsp;</em>Direct. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The&nbsp;<em>FBN </em>network is&nbsp;now powered by over 110,000 fields and 90 million acre events of real world agronomic data, all from real farmers.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Working at <em>Farmers Business Network</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You'll be surrounded by colleagues who are dedicated to serving farmers, revolutionizing farming and to exceeding their own high standards. &nbsp;As a Silicon Valley and Midwestern based company, we believe in the power of getting things done, working in small teams, and understand that creativity is fostered by transparency and open communication.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Farmers are the ultimate entrepreneurs, able to fix things with duct tape and baling wire while building their businesses when the odds are often stacked against them. Our teammates have deep experience in agriculture, technology, data science, machine learning, and biology among other areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our employees think very big, invent, build, and just get stuff done. We embrace the adventure of simplifying terabytes of complex data and building products that have never existed and answering questions that have never been answered.</span></p>
<h3><strong>We Look Forward to Meeting You</strong></h3>

These assistants will free people up to focus on the higher-level, creative aspects of their work.</p>
We’re building a system of intelligence for every company in the world. On the surface, you can think of it as Google + ChatGPT for the enterprise. Under the hood, our platform is the connective tissue between AI and knowledge. It brings all of a company’s knowledge together, understands it at a deep level, provides industry-leading search relevance over it, and connects it to generative AI agents and applications.<br>
<p><a href=""https://glean.com/"">Glean</a>&nbsp;was founded by a seasoned team of former Google search and Facebook engineers who saw a need in the enterprise space for their technical depth and passion for AI. We’re a diverse team of curious and creative people who want to help each other get big things done—so we can help other teams do the same.&nbsp;</p>

Inflection AI,Greenhouse,inflectionai,"<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">About Inflection</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We are a small, friendly and multi-disciplinary AI studio creating a personal AI for everyone. Our first AI is called Pi, for personal intelligence, a supportive and empathetic conversational AI. Our studio is made up of the world's leading AI developers, creative designers, writers and innovators working together in a deeply multidisciplinary style to create a brand new class of digital experiences.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Where We Work</span></h2>
<p>We work in a hybrid model. During the week we’re in the office 2-3 times per week and currently hiring in Palo Alto and London.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We work on a 6 week cycle. Every 7th week, we convene together in person as a company to brainstorm, bond and build.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How We Work</span></h2>
<p><em>We value excellence and ownership.</em>&nbsp;Our organizational structure focuses on individual responsibilities rather than management hierarchies. Everyone is expected to lead by doing. We are big believers in the unreasonable effectiveness of highly talented Individual Contributors who are given all the resources, space and ownership to move fast and deliver outstanding results.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Teamwork and generosity are at our core.</em>&nbsp;Our culture celebrates positive challenges, asking questions, learning and actively supporting one another. This mentality of shared respect and purposeful teamwork is key to our success. We equally value all technical and non-technical contributions.</p>
<p><em>Constructive disagreement is essential.</em>&nbsp;We appreciate when team members challenge assumptions, put forward new ideas, or encourage us to move faster or slower. Openness, honesty and kindness make us great.</p>
<p><em>Feedback is our ground truth.</em>&nbsp;We have a tight feedback loop between the user experience and our AI creation process. Quantitative and qualitative data drives our priorities. This goes for internal culture too. Everyone has ownership and visibility into key decisions and progress.</p>
<p><em>Writing creates accountability.</em>&nbsp;Whether on internal communication tools or in team memos, we are strong communicators with a special focus on the written word.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>We deeply value time to reset outside of work.</em>&nbsp;We encourage one another to constantly take time to recharge and always focus on maintaining a healthy work-life balance.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Engineering at Inflection</span></h2>
<p>We are a vertically integrated AI studio. This means that our entire technology stack – from large foundational model pre-training to the user interface – is built in-house, with each of the components co-optimized to deliver the best AI experiences.

The Zwift platform delivers an at-home training game that connects cyclists and runners in over 200 countries across the globe! Launched from the sunny shores of Long Beach, California in 2014, we’ve grown to have a distributed workforce across the world.</span></p>
<p><strong>Some reasons we think you will love it here:</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At Zwift, we want to inspire each other, build on each other’s ideas, and celebrate the wins together. We all play a role in the success of Zwift, and it takes Watopians (that’s what we call our employees!) across the globe to make it all happen. Love cycling? Awesome. Haven’t ridden a bike since you were 8? Cool. Never learned how to ride a bike? We’ve got the best teachers if you want to learn. If not, no sweat. We celebrate the value of different perspectives. That’s how we grow and become an inclusive game, company, and community.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We are a passionate, energized, and innovative team. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We like bikes. We like running. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We admire a healthy work/life balance too - offering “Wednesday Wellness” to all Watopians to prioritize wellness for your body and mind.</span></p>

<p><strong>The Future of Work at Zwift</strong></p>

This system needs to be safe, it must have fully wireless communication through the skin, and it has to be ready for patients to take home and use on their own. Our device, called the Link, will be able to record from 1024 electrodes and is designed to meet these criteria.</p>

Phaidra,Greenhouse,phaidra,"<p>Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.</p>
<p>The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.</p>
<p>Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;intelligence&nbsp;is provided by reinforcement learning algorithms, which convert raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.</li>
<li>We focus on&nbsp;industrial&nbsp;applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs —&nbsp;perfect for reinforcement learning.</li>
<li>We enable domain experts (our users) to&nbsp;configure&nbsp;the AI control&nbsp;systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961"" target=""_blank"">DeepMind's AlphaGo</a>, to reducing the energy required to cool&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/08/17/140987/google-just-gave-control-over-data-center-cooling-to-an-ai/"" target=""_blank"">Google's Data Centers</a>&nbsp;by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.</p>
<p>Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, <a href=""https://www.oysterhr.com/"" target=""_blank"">OysterHR</a>. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Portugal, and India.</p>
<p>We are thoughtful about remote collaboration. We look to the pioneers - like Gitlab - for inspiration and best practices to create a stellar remote work environment. We have a documentation-first culture and actively practice asynchronous communication in everything we do. Our team stays connected through tools like Slack and video chat. Most teams meet daily, and we have dedicated all-hands meetings bi-weekly to build strong relationships. We hold virtual team building events once per month - and even hold virtual socials to watch rocket launches! We have a yearly in-person, all-company summit in locations like Seattle, Athens, Goa, and Barcelona.</p>

Pyka,Greenhouse,pyka,"<p>Pyka’s goal is to provide society with a new form of safe, clean, and cost-effective transportation enabled by autonomous electric aviation. <br><br>To get there, we’re taking a different approach than most. We're applying our technologies to every industry where autonomous electric aircraft can be useful, starting with the highest value and most dangerous jobs. In doing so, we're building game-changing products manufactured at scale, while perfecting the safety, reliability, and capabilities of our autonomy engine and electric propulsion systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We design, develop and manufacture an ecosystem of technologies including proprietary flight control software, avionics, high power density motors, motor controllers, batteries, and custom carbon-fiber composite airframes.</p>
<p>Today, we supply autonomous electric aircraft for cargo transport and crop protection to real-world customers across four separate continents and have secured industry-first regulatory approvals from the FAA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our cargo aircraft enables remote connectivity, enhances express delivery networks, and ensures fast and reliable shipping of critical supplies to areas in need. Our crop protection aircraft offers agricultural services providers and farmers an autonomous tool to make aerial application safer, more precise, and less harmful to surrounding environments. Both vehicles are highly economical to operate, easy to deploy, and significantly reduce CO2 emissions in their respective industries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2014, we built Recharge to make payments easy for everyone. By constantly finding solutions for customers to reorder products, we've helped over 10,000 online merchants dramatically grow and thrive. We have two missions at Recharge: make it easy for people to sell subscription products online, and create an amazing remote-first culture.</p>
<p>The first mission began as three people working out of a small apartment, trying to solve one of the biggest problems facing Shopify merchants: recurring payments. Now we’re at the forefront of recurring billing software, empowering thousands of entrepreneurs to sell their products as subscriptions, and processing tens of millions of dollars in sales every week.</p>
<p>Our culture is remote-first and we stay connected every day using Slack and video chat. Being part of a small, fast-growing company is exciting. The opportunities to grow and take ownership at Recharge are endless and we’ll make sure you have everything you need to do your best work and make a big impact.</p>

<p class=""p1"">The best people are everywhere, not just in the radius around our headquarters in Santa Monica, California. That’s why we have expanded our horizons all the way from the Andes in Argentina to the Rockies in Denver, Colorado. We've found that broadening our reach to build a remote team enables us to uncover outstanding talent&nbsp;and currently have over 100 employees around the globe.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The Recharge team maintains a work-life balance approach. It’s not our goal to dash through the sprints, but rather to focus on building the future. We understand that hobbies exist and encourage our employees to pursue them. You’ll find out quickly that our team surfs, hikes, cycles, reads (hardcovers!), and festival hops - all while exceeding performance expectations at work.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Above all, we realize if you empower people to pursue their passions, they will help change the world.&nbsp;</p>

Sparrow,Greenhouse,sparrow,"<p>Sparrow is a modern, leave management HR software - the first end-to-end solution for all kinds of leaves. With incredible traction, thousands of leaves managed - we are positioned to be an industry leader. Our leave specialists are experts that care about helping employers and employees when they need it most. With negligible customer churn and an NPS score of 76, we know that our customers love us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our mission is to make it simple for companies to provide their employees with all kinds of leave (i.e. family, medical, etc.). Currently, the leave management process is painful and inefficient for everyone - company leaders struggle to keep up with regulations and processes that change frequently, and the employees going on leave are overwhelmed by bureaucracy at an exceptionally important juncture in their career. Sparrow transforms this ordinarily tedious, error-prone, complex to remain compliant, and time-consuming process into a 30-minute end-to-end experience saving teams time (20 - 40 hours per leave) and money (up to $30K per leave).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

STX Group,Greenhouse,stxgroup,"<p><strong>STX Group</strong></p>
<p>A lot has changed since 2005, when STX Group was founded as a small-scale intermediary company in the heart of Amsterdam. Starting out modestly, but ambitiously as one of the first European players in the Carbon Emission (EUA) market, the firm has grown over the years into a reputable international intermediary and trading company that employs over 250 staff members and covers a wide range of products on the global market. Working from offices in Amsterdam, Gothenburg, Hamburg, Lyon, New York and Singapore, our various teams draw on their entrepreneurial mindset to serve our clients optimally in their own languages. Our goal? To consolidate growth in dynamic existing markets while further exploring new products and emerging markets. Ultimately, our mission is to become a leading trader and market access provider in illiquid environmental commodities and debt capital markets.</p>
<p><strong>Growth through new products and markets</strong></p>
<p>These days, STX Group serves as a intermediary, principle and proprietary trader in the international renewables market and financial markets. On the environmental commodities side, we intermediate and trade a wide variety of different renewable energy certificates and physical renewables, such as biofuels and biodiesel. Over the years, we have expanded to trade in a diverse range of new products and have moved into numerous new markets. Such developments account for the rapid growth the company has enjoyed since its inception.</p>
<p><strong>Entrepreneurialism and diversity as key success factors</strong></p>
<p>The only thing that hasn’t changed since 2005 is the location of our headquarters: we’re still based alongside Amsterdam’s canals in the vibrant heart of the city. To date, we remain one of the few intermediaries in the Dutch capital and one of the only trading firms to have such an international employee base serving the global market. A key driver behind the company’s growth and success is the great diversity within our teams: not only does our in-house staff base comprise an impressive 30+ different nationalities, but the (academic) backgrounds of our team members vary widely too. This diversity guarantees that, as a group, we can tap into the creativity and versatility required to continuously develop only the best and most innovative ideas and solutions to problems we encounter. Great performance is rewarded with great growth within the company. We don’t believe in silos; we operate as teams. Cross-country, cross-disciplinary and cross-position collaboration is key. We don’t place much emphasis on hierarchical structures. What we <em>do</em> value? Entrepreneurial spirits who have great ideas and are keen to join the STX family to work on building the future together.</p>",stxgroup.com,https://stxgroup.com/careers/vacancies/,,https://boards.greenhouse.io/stxgroup,https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/stxgroup,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,

The Farmer's Dog,Greenhouse,thefarmersdog,"<h3>ABOUT THE FARMER'S DOG</h3>
<p>Our company was inspired by a puppy named Jada. Just a simple change in diet — from highly processed brown balls to fresh meat and veggies — had miraculous effects on her overall health. Jada’s dad, Brett, and his co-founder, Jonathan realized the commercial pet food industry was putting more energy into creating beautiful bags and marketing fluff than truly healthy dog products. So they teamed up with top veterinary nutritionists to create exactly the fresh, complete, and convenient pet food service that they wished existed for their own dogs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using proprietary technology, age, breed, size, activity level, sensitivities and more are all factored into each pup’s personalized plan. The veterinarian-designed meals are cooked in a USDA-certified kitchen, then delivered in ready-to-serve packages within days of preparation — unlike the shelf-stable, preservative-riddled commercial options.</p>
<p>The Farmer’s Dog is creating a new class of consumer brand, bringing peace of mind to our customers, health to their companions, and fundamentally changing the way people think about living life with their pets.&nbsp;</p>

More about Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands. 

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships. 

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions. 

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel. 

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

 Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline. 

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

<p>TripActions is the fastest-growing corporate travel platform disrupting a $1.5T industry and shaping the future of business travel.</p>
<p>TripActions is a story of inspiration born of frustration. Road warriors and co-founders Ariel Cohen and Ilan Twig believed that companies deserved a travel solution that takes the pain out of work trips –– so that their travelers can focus on being productive and meeting in-person, not wasting valuable time booking travel. So in 2015, they created TripActions. Since then, we’ve been a mission to power the face-to-face, in-person connections that move people, ideas and businesses forward.</p>
<p>TripActions’ platform offers a vast selection of inventory that travelers can choose from, a personalized, intuitive user interface driven by machine learning, and 24/7 proactive real human, customer support. Companies enjoy complete travel program visibility, over 30% cost savings on average and seamless integrations with their HR and expense systems.</p>
<p>Globally, TripActions has grown to over 600 employees across 7 offices in 4 countries. We support over 1,500 customers, with innovative brands like Lyft, Dropbox, Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, Allbirds, Robinhood and the ACLU relying on TripActions for their business travel needs. As one of Silicon Valley’s newest “unicorns”, TripActions has a valuation north of $1B and a total of $232M in funding. We’ve recently received $154M in our Series C funding round –– led by new investor Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from repeat investors Lightspeed Venture Partners, Zeev Ventures and SGVC.</p>
<p>TripActions was recently recognized as one of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies for 2019, #12 in LinkedIn’s Top Startups 2018 and #3 in the U.S. for Happiest Employees by Comparably.</p>

Twelve,Greenhouse,twelve,"<p><strong>We're the Carbon Transformation Company</strong></p>
<p>We're Twelve, the carbon transformation company—a new kind of chemical company that makes things from air, not oil. Our breakthrough technology eliminates emissions by transforming CO2 into critical materials, products and fuels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to addressing climate change, carbon isn’t our nemesis. To the contrary, we see carbon as the <a href=""https://medium.com/@twelve.CO2/the-element-of-change-is-in-the-air-d0248aebbaee"" target=""_blank"">element of change</a>. Carbon isn’t just the building block of life, it’s the building block of the chemicals, materials and fuels that make up our modern world and power innovation. From the spring in our running shoes to our favorite electronics, to building materials, electric car parts and fuels, carbon makes it possible. The problem is we get this carbon today from fossil fuels in the form of petrochemicals, which creates CO2&nbsp;emissions and accelerates climate change.</p>
<p>Carbon transformation fundamentally changes this paradigm by sourcing carbon from CO2&nbsp;instead of fossil fuels. By replacing the fossil carbon in critical chemicals with renewable, recycled carbon from CO2, we can eliminate emissions from thousands of essential products and set a new standard for how things get made in the climate era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We're Building a Team That's Never Existed Before</strong></p>
<p>At Twelve, we combine multiple scientific, engineering and operational disciplines to take our technology from the original science to an industrial solution that puts a dent in climate change. It takes everybody and more to create an entirely new industry based on a technology that never existed before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Join Our Mission to Build a Climate-Positive World and Fossil-Free Future</strong></p>
<p>We are on a mission to build a fossil free-future, and reinvent what it means to be a chemical company in the climate era. Our carbon transformation technology is the keystone of a circular, non-extractive, fossil-free chemical and energy system of the future. Join us!</p>

We dismantle and sort used battery packs 7x faster and 50% cheaper than by hand using robotics, AI and sound for EV OEMs, battery makers and fleets. Once we dismantle 1000s of battery packs, we repurpose them into $4000 cheap grid batteries that are 20% cheaper than making new ones. Our vision is to become the leading maker of zero-impact batteries by building 1 million batteries/year by 2035. This will power a truly clean energy revolution at scale and reduce 6 Giga tons of CO2 by 2050. We are Universe Energy, and we make batteries eternal.</p>

Vestwell,Greenhouse,vestwell,"<p><strong>Who Are We?</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are over 30M small businesses in the United States, but only a tiny fraction of them have a workplace savings program in place.&nbsp; As the savings gap in the country widens, it’s imperative that every worker has access to and participates in their company’s savings program, such as a 401(k) or 403(b).&nbsp; We believe that American workers should have easy access to an inexpensive, flexible, and intuitive solution to save for a brighter future.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unfortunately, prior to Vestwell, small businesses have been neglected and underserved, with expensive, inflexible, poorly designed offerings built on old, mainframe software.&nbsp; Vestwell is changing that, starting with rebuilding the core infrastructure for the modern era.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vestwell’s north star is to be the engine behind a $30T industry, powering all payroll-deducted workplace savings programs for small-to-midsize businesses, such as 401(k), 403(b), IRA, emergency savings accounts (ESA), health savings accounts (HSA), 529 college savings, and alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vestwell’s focus is to build the most flexible, powerful workplace savings and investment platform, delivered through the hands and minds of their financial services partners with the help of payroll provider partners. The team at Vestwell makes the hard stuff look easy, by combining the expertise of financial advice with the sophistication of a technology provider.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a result, workplace providers are able to bestow the advice and solution employers and employees have been asking for, while growing and scaling along the way. Employers get a cost-effective solution designed for their needs without all the headaches, and employees get a user-friendly portal that helps them achieve their long-term saving goals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Why Vestwell?</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With backing from leading FinTech investors, as well as a growing team of dedicated professionals of strong industry pedigree, Vestwell is at the forefront of a much-needed change in a 40-year old industry. Our team believes in the mission we’ve set out to achieve and we are working hard to get there. We’re ambitious, honest, thoughtful, and fun.</span></p>

Civitech is an Austin, Texas based startup that is applying modern technology-based solutions to civic problems.

Civitech simplifies the process of launching and running a campaign, from fundraising to voter outreach. Political campaigns are expensive and inefficient, frequently spending their limited resources reaching out to the same people over and over because the existing software solutions don’t talk to each other. Civitech integrates with the existing software solutions, simplifies the big picture of a campaign, and uses social media and voter registration to reach out to voters who are frequently left out of the process.

Civitech provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, marital status, amnesty, or status as a covered veteran in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws.

House Values
One Team
Optimize for the company, your team, self - in that order. We may fight long and hard in the trenches, take care of your co-workers with empathy. We give more than we take to build the one house, that everyone dreams of being part of.

Tough & Persevering 
We are building our company in a very large, fast-growing but highly competitive space. Life will get tough sometimes. We take hardships in the stride, be positive, focus all energy on the path forward and develop a champion's mindset to overcome odds. Always day one!

Keep Making It Better Always
Rome was not built in a day; If we can get 1% better each day for one year, we'll end up thirty-seven times better. This means being organized, communicating promptly, taking even small tasks seriously, tracking all small ideas, and paying it forward.

Think Big, Act Fast
We have tremendous scope for innovation, but we will still be judged by impact over time. Big, bold ideas still need to be strategized against priorities, broken down, set in rapid motion, measure, refine, repeat. Great execution is what separates promising companies from proven unicorns.

Be Customer Obsessed
Everyone has the responsibility to drive towards the best experience for the customer, be an OSS user or a paid customer. If something is broken, own it, say something, do something; never ignore. Be the change that you want to see in the company.

About Biobot 

At Biobot, we are working together to build a team environment in which everyone can thrive and is proud to belong.

We encourage applications from candidates of all identities and backgrounds, including those who are traditionally underrepresented in technology startups.

Our mission is to transform wastewater infrastructure into public health observatories. 

Named as one of Fast Company’s most innovative companies in the world in 2021, Biobot Analytics is a wastewater epidemiology company and uses technology developed at MIT to measure biomarkers in sewage to better understand population health in cities. We first launched an opioid product to support government and public health officials in responding to the opioid epidemic, and in 2020 launched a Covid19 product to estimate the scope and trend of the outbreak in communities. We have operated in almost 500 communities across 43 U.S. states, generating Covid19 case estimates for over 13% of the U.S. population.

Battling the opioid epidemic and now the Covid19 pandemic is just the beginning - we’re transforming sewage into a data asset and building a public health database. Eventually, Biobot data will be an early warning system for disease outbreaks, a map of nutrition disparities, and more. Headquartered in the Boston area with an office in NYC, we aim to create the bedrock of human health infrastructure and smart cities in countries across all six continents.

Since the very beginning, we’ve been committed to building an inclusive culture. We are proud that people from all over the world have combined forces to give Dixa a universal perspective.
However, there are areas where we simply need to do better, and we appreciate that there are perspectives and experiences which many of us do not fully understand – yet.
We want our Dixaterians to bring their true selves to work, irrespective of nationality, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, physical ability, age, or economic background. We’re committed to learning, growing, and educating ourselves on experiences outside of our own, because we believe everyone deserves an equitable future.

Dixa’s Conversational Customer Service Platform combines powerful AI with a human touch to deliver a personalized-service experience that scales. Dixa powers more than 30 million conversations a year and is trusted by leading brands such as Interflora, On, Wise, Deezer, Rapha, Too Good to Go, Hello Print, and Wistia. 

We started out as four friends around a kitchen table, on a mission to radically change the customer service space, while building a people-first and values-driven culture from the get-go. 
Now, we’re in scale-up territory, backed by incredible VCs (raising Series C in July 2021), and 150+ exceptional Dixaterians working with us in 4 offices (and remotely)! 
This incredible momentum is fuelling our mission to once and for all eliminate bad customer service and create a world in which all people are welcomed by their favorite brands with the warm familiarity of a friend 💜.

Then there's our eclectic program of monthly events where we bring the outside in, working with local creatives to curate events unique to each location.

We proved that style didn’t need to be sacrificed for value and honest pricing is still very much at the heart of everything we do. We opened our second London hotel in 2014, followed by Amsterdam in 2015, Paris in 2017 and Williamsburg, Los Angeles, Portland, and Chicago all coming soon. Each hotel has its own character; however, you’ll find the familiar Hoxton Hustle, incorporating the uniqueness of their neighborhoods using local designers, artists, and illustrators for everything from interiors to wallpaper, art and neighborhood guides.

The Hoxton, Portland will be situated in an iconic building with an incredible history dating back to 1906. Located in Portland’s Old Town Chinatown, The Hoxton, Portland will have vibrant, welcoming public spaces providing a place where guests can hangout alongside the locals and submerse themselves in the neighborhood, 119 bedrooms, a rooftop restaurant and basement bar.

Topography Health is seeking a highly organized and proactive Budgets & Contracts Specialist to support budget and contract negotiations with life sciences companies sponsoring clinical research. The ideal candidate will have a keen eye for detail and be adept at driving the budget and contract process from review to negotiation to signature to filing, in accordance with company policies and high quality standards, while keeping interested parties informed as to the status of the project and any potential roadblocks.

Strong planning and organizational skills and the ability to work independently and effectively in a fast-paced, dynamic environment with competing priorities is a must.

KEY RESPONSIBILITIES
Serve as a proactive and positive liaison between Topography Health’s Legal Team/Finance Team and industry sponsors, as well as our internal business partners and physician investigators. 
Read and interpret clinical trial study documents including Protocol, Budget, Contract, Informed Consent, and Laboratory Manuals and provide concise summaries to team members. 
Draft, review, negotiate, and process contracts and budgets with accuracy and in accordance with fixed deadlines and company standards, including clinical trial agreements and budgets/payment terms, amendments, statements of work, vendor agreements, master services agreements, project orders, letters of indemnity, and other standard research agreements, while adhering to quality standards and maintaining version control. 
Manage a high complexity workflow and be accountable to monitor and maintain internal SLAs for response times and outcomes. 
Process electronic signatures in accordance with applicable regulations and maintain and organize contract repositories.
Work directly with our Legal Team to escalate and analyze complex legal issues, including privacy issues, and track communications and positions for long-term knowledge management.
Help develop and implement playbooks to improve contract and budget templates and streamline processes (including technology-based processes). 
Contribute to data analysis and support the development and implementation of reporting to keep stakeholders informed of metrics  relevant to their operations. 
Assist with other projects as assigned.

In alignment with its business operations, Kodiak adheres to all relevant U.S. national security statutes, regulations, and administrative prerequisites. These statutes  may impose limitations on Kodiak's capacity to engage specific individuals in particular roles based on various national security-related criteria. Consequently, the eligibility for this position may hinge on Kodiak's verification of a candidate's residence, U.S. person status, and/or citizenship status. In accordance with these statutes , Kodiak may find it necessary to secure a U.S. government export license before disseminating its technologies to specific individuals. Should Kodiak determine that a candidate's residence, U.S. person status, and/or citizenship status necessitate a license, prohibit the candidate from assuming this position, or otherwise fall under national security-related restrictions, Kodiak explicitly retains the right to either assess the candidate for an alternative position unaffected by such restrictions, under terms and conditions set forth at Kodiak's sole discretion, or, as an alternative, opt not to proceed with the candidate's application.

Our customers trust us to manage their space infrastructure, so they can focus on what matters most to them: operating their mission and collecting their data.

OakNorth,Lever,oaknorth.ai,"About Us
We’re OakNorth Bank and we embolden entrepreneurs to realise their ambitions, understand their markets, and apply data intelligence to everyday decisions to scale successfully at pace.  
Banking should be barrier-free. It’s a belief at our very core, inspired by our entrepreneurial spirit, driven by the unmet financial needs of millions, and delivered by our data-driven tools. 
And for those who love helping businesses thrive? Our savings accounts help diversify the high street and create new jobs, all while earning savers some of the highest interest on the market.  
But we go beyond finance, to empower our people, encourage professional growth and create an environment where everyone can thrive. We strive to create an inclusive and diverse workplace where people can be themselves and succeed. 
Our story 
OakNorth Bank was built on the foundations of frustrations with old-school banking. In 2005, when our founders tried to get capital for their data analytics company, the computer said ‘no’. Unfortunately, all major banks in the UK were using the same computer – and it was broken.  
Why was it so difficult for a profitable business with impressive cashflow, retained clients, and clear commercial success to get a loan?  
The industry was backward-looking and too focused on historic financials, rather than future potential. 
So, what if there was a bank, founded by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs? One that offered a dramatically better borrowing experience for businesses? 
No more what ifs, OakNorth Bank exists.

Yard Stick PBC,Lever,yardstick,"Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

Yard Stick’s impact goals go well beyond climate science. Why? Our company operates primarily in the US agricultural sector, which is predicated on centuries of mass land theft and disenfranchisement of Native and Black people. This harm continues today. If we’re going to work in this sector, we need to leave it better than we found it.

Consistent with our core value of “Pursue Justice,” we speak up about these issues, and we support emerging solutions and relevant policy efforts such as H.R.40 and S.300. We also publicly highlight the risk of further racial discrimination in emerging agricultural legislation like the Growing Climate Solutions Act and in press coverage ensure that the discrimination in past and present US agriculture is part of the conversation right alongside more typical topics like who our customers are, or how our tech works.

Regarding hiring and culture, we work to create a work environment where everyone feels confident sharing their ideas, problem-solving happens openly and collaboratively, and mistake-making is welcomed. We’ve recently organized lunchtime all-team discussions on issues like labor equity in Florida produce, Pigford v. Glickman (the largest US civil rights settlement in history), and other contemporary moral concerns in agriculture. When hiring, we standardize our interview process and questions to reduce “likeability” bias, benchmark salaries against industry databases to reduce negotiation, and utilize tools like the Gender Decoder. Climate change is arguably the most complex challenge ever faced by humanity - we need all of humanity activated to fight back, and that motivates us to build a diverse team.
